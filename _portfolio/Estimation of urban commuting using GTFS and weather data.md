Though many studies have examined the impact of commuting time for various purposes, this project is a first try at investigating the relationship between NJ Transit bus commuting travel times and related weather patterns. By analyzing and examining NJ Transit arrival and departures and historical weather datasets, we find no correlation between weather conditions and bus travel time as well as the day of week. However we find meaningful pattern between the departure time and average bus travel time.
