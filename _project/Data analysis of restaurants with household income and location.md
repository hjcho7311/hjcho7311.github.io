title: "[Data analysis of restaurants with household income and location](https://github.com/hjcho7311/Realtime-and-Big-Data-Analytics)"
excerpt: "Using Hadoop, Hive and NYU cloud, analyzed the relationship between consumer restaurant choice and income level by zip code.<br/><br/>This project is a first try at investigating the relationship between consumer restaurant choice and income level by zipcode. We posit that if a restaurant choice of consumer is related with income, we can predict consumer's eat out patterns based on the consumer's income level. Analyzing two datasets the Yelp business data with restaurant type and associated Yelp rating, and household income organized by zipcode, we find a positive correlation between certain types
of food with income levels."

This project is a first try at investigating the relationship between consumer restaurant choice and income level by zipcode. We posit that if a restaurant choice of consumer is related with income, we can predict consumer's eat out patterns based on the consumer's income level. Analyzing two datasets the Yelp business data with restaurant type and associated Yelp rating, and household income organized by zipcode, we find a positive correlation between certain types
of food with income levels.
